# Multiplayer Lobby Package Handoff

## Project Purpose
A reusable Go package for managing multiplayer lobbies in games and real-time applications. Designed for easy integration, extensibility, and demonstration in portfolio and real-world projects.

## Architectural Overview
- **Domain Layer:** Lobby, Player, Session, state transitions, business rules
- **Repository Abstraction:** In-memory implementation, pluggable for other backends
- **Manager/Service Layer:** LobbyManager orchestrates lobby operations and event hooks
- **Session Management:** UserSession tracking with secure token-based authentication
- **Event Hooks:** Callbacks for join, leave, full, empty, deleted, etc.
- **Transport-Agnostic:** Host app wires up transport (WebSocket, HTTP, etc.)

## Current Status
- ✅ **Core Features Implemented:**
  - Create/join/leave/list lobbies, ready status, event hooks
  - Secure session management with token-based authentication
  - WebSocket integration with message routing
  - Connection monitoring and cleanup
  - Comprehensive event system
- ✅ **Security:** Session hijacking vulnerability has been fixed with secure token-based authentication
- ✅ **Documentation:** Well-documented with GoDoc comments and comprehensive README
- ✅ **Testing:** Unit tests for core logic, integration tests, and security tests
- ✅ **Demo:** Complete WebSocket demo with React frontend
- ✅ **API Design:** Type-safe action constants and automatic handler setup

## **SECURITY STATUS - RESOLVED ✅**

### **Session Hijacking Vulnerability - FIXED**
The critical session hijacking vulnerability has been **completely resolved**:

#### **What Was Fixed:**
1. **Added Secure Session Tokens:** Each session now has a cryptographically secure 32-byte token
2. **Token-Based Authentication:** All operations now require valid session tokens
3. **Secure Token Generation:** Using `crypto/rand` for cryptographically secure tokens
4. **Client-Side Token Storage:** Frontend properly stores and sends session tokens
5. **Comprehensive Validation:** All handlers validate tokens before processing requests

#### **Security Improvements:**
```go
// ✅ SECURE CODE - Token-based authentication prevents session hijacking
if session, valid := sessionManager.ValidateSessionToken(req.Username, req.Token); valid {
    // Only proceed if token is valid for this username
    // Attacker cannot claim sessions without the correct token
}
```

#### **Security Tests:**
- ✅ All session hijacking attempts are properly blocked
- ✅ Cross-token validation fails as expected
- ✅ Invalid tokens are rejected
- ✅ Non-existent users cannot be claimed
- ✅ Legitimate users with correct tokens work properly

### **Current Security Status:**
- **Production Ready:** The package is now safe for production deployment
- **No Known Vulnerabilities:** All identified security issues have been resolved
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Security tests verify protection against session hijacking

## Next Development Priorities

### 1. **Enhanced Lobby Management** (Medium Priority)
- **Lobby Host/Admin**: Designate lobby creator as host with special privileges
- **Kick Players**: Allow host to remove players
- **Lobby Settings**: Allow host to modify lobby settings (max players, privacy)
- **Lobby Chat**: Basic text chat functionality
- **Lobby Invites**: Private lobby codes/links

### 2. **Improved User Experience** (Medium Priority)
- **Real-time Updates**: Better WebSocket event handling for live updates
- **Player Avatars**: Add avatar/icon support
- **Lobby Categories**: Tag lobbies by game type
- **Search/Filter**: Filter lobbies by various criteria
- **Persistent Sessions**: Remember user preferences

### 3. **Advanced Features** (Lower Priority)
- **Game Integration**: Hooks for actual game launching
- **Spectator Mode**: Allow non-playing observers
- **Tournament Support**: Bracket-style lobby organization
- **Analytics**: Track lobby usage and player behavior
- **Mobile Support**: Responsive design improvements

### 4. **Infrastructure & Reliability** (Ongoing)
- **Error Handling**: More robust error recovery
- **Performance**: Optimize for larger numbers of concurrent lobbies
- **Monitoring**: Add metrics and health checks
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and DoS attacks
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs

## Recent Improvements Made
- ✅ **Secure Session Management:** Token-based authentication prevents session hijacking
- ✅ **Auto-Reconnection:** Players automatically return to their lobby when reconnecting with valid tokens
- ✅ **Session Management:** Robust user session tracking with secure cleanup
- ✅ **Connection Monitoring:** WebSocket ping/pong with timeout handling
- ✅ **API Improvements:** Type-safe action constants and automatic handler setup
- ✅ **Event System:** Comprehensive callback system for all lobby events
- ✅ **Security Testing:** Comprehensive tests verify protection against attacks

## Best Practices
- **Security First:** Always validate user identity and session ownership using tokens
- **Keep the package generic and decoupled from game logic**
- **Use semantic versioning and tag releases**
- **Expand tests and examples as features are added**
- **Document all public APIs and event hooks**
- **Encourage contributions and feedback if open source**
