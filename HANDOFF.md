# Multiplayer Lobby Package Handoff

## Project Purpose
A reusable, production-quality Go package for managing multiplayer lobbies in games and real-time applications. Designed for easy integration, extensibility, and demonstration in portfolio and real-world projects.

## Architectural Overview
- **Domain Layer:** Lobby, Player, state transitions, business rules
- **Repository Abstraction:** In-memory implementation, pluggable for other backends
- **Manager/Service Layer:** LobbyManager orchestrates lobby operations and event hooks
- **Event Hooks:** Callbacks for join, leave, full, empty, etc.
- **No Networking:** Host app wires up transport (WebSocket, HTTP, etc.)

## Current Status
- Core features implemented: create/join/leave/list lobbies, ready status, event hooks, in-memory storage
- Well-documented with GoDoc comments and README
- Unit tests for core logic and event triggering
- Usage examples in README
- Tagged as v1.0.0 (in monorepo)

## Next Steps
1. **Extract to Standalone Module/Repo**
   - Move this directory to its own repository (e.g., github.com/jonosm/multiplayer-lobby)
   - Run `go mod init github.com/jonosm/multiplayer-lobby` in the new repo
   - Push to GitHub and tag a release (v1.0.0)
2. **Update Downstream Projects**
   - Update all projects (e.g., demo backend) to import the package using the new module path
   - Run `go get github.com/jonosm/multiplayer-lobby@latest` in those projects
3. **(Optional) Publish/Promote**
   - Add to pkg.go.dev, write a blog post, or share in portfolio

## Best Practices
- Keep the package generic and decoupled from game logic
- Use semantic versioning and tag releases
- Expand tests and examples as features are added
- Document all public APIs and event hooks
- Encourage contributions and feedback if open source

## Contact / Repo Info
- Repo: (to be set after extraction, e.g., github.com/jonosm/multiplayer-lobby)
- For questions, open an issue or contact the maintainer

**This handoff ensures the next agent can maintain, extend, and publish the multiplayer-lobby package with confidence.**
