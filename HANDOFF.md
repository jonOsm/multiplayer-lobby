# Multiplayer Lobby Package Handoff

## Project Purpose
A reusable, production-quality Go package for managing multiplayer lobbies in games and real-time applications. Designed for easy integration, extensibility, and demonstration in portfolio and real-world projects.

## Architectural Overview
- **Domain Layer:** Lobby, Player, state transitions, business rules
- **Repository Abstraction:** In-memory implementation, pluggable for other backends
- **Manager/Service Layer:** LobbyManager orchestrates lobby operations and event hooks
- **Event Hooks:** Callbacks for join, leave, full, empty, etc.
- **No Networking:** Host app wires up transport (WebSocket, HTTP, etc.)

## Current Status
- Core features implemented: create/join/leave/list lobbies, ready status, event hooks, in-memory storage
- Well-documented with GoDoc comments and README
- Unit tests for core logic and event triggering
- Usage examples in README
- Published as standalone module (v1.0.0)
- Demo backend and frontend integration complete

## Next Development Priorities

### 1. **Add Game Starting Functionality** (High Priority)
**Backend Changes:**
- Add `start_game` action to WebSocket handler
- Implement game start validation (all players ready, minimum players)
- Add lobby state transition from `waiting` â†’ `in_game`
- Add game session management

**Frontend Changes:**
- Make "Start Game" button functional
- Add game mode UI
- Handle game state transitions

### 2. **Enhanced Lobby Management** (Medium Priority)
- **Lobby Host/Admin**: Designate lobby creator as host with special privileges
- **Kick Players**: Allow host to remove players
- **Lobby Settings**: Allow host to modify lobby settings (max players, privacy)
- **Lobby Chat**: Basic text chat functionality
- **Lobby Invites**: Private lobby codes/links

### 3. **Improved User Experience** (Medium Priority)
- **Real-time Updates**: Better WebSocket event handling for live updates
- **Player Avatars**: Add avatar/icon support
- **Lobby Categories**: Tag lobbies by game type
- **Search/Filter**: Filter lobbies by various criteria
- **Persistent Sessions**: Remember user preferences

### 4. **Advanced Features** (Lower Priority)
- **Game Integration**: Hooks for actual game launching
- **Spectator Mode**: Allow non-playing observers
- **Tournament Support**: Bracket-style lobby organization
- **Analytics**: Track lobby usage and player behavior
- **Mobile Support**: Responsive design improvements

### 5. **Infrastructure & Reliability** (Ongoing)
- **Error Handling**: More robust error recovery
- **Connection Management**: Handle disconnections gracefully
- **Performance**: Optimize for larger numbers of concurrent lobbies
- **Monitoring**: Add metrics and health checks
- **Security**: Input validation, rate limiting

## Best Practices
- Keep the package generic and decoupled from game logic
- Use semantic versioning and tag releases
- Expand tests and examples as features are added
- Document all public APIs and event hooks
- Encourage contributions and feedback if open source
